          <li><strong>Chapter 1:</strong><br> The first chapter is all about touching up on the previous videos. Showing some jargon, basic database acronyms, and going over things you should know before starting databases. </li>
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          <li><strong>Chapter 2:</strong><br> My challenge for this chapter was to navigate throught a few daabases. Exploring through was fairly easy but still basic but the language seem pretty straight forward. </li>

           <li><strong>Chapter 4:</strong><br> Chapter 4 was taking a look at variety of different function. We looked at how to find a specific rows in a table or getting counts on certain items. Challenge was to write a query to "Determine how much older someone is?". This was the Query 'SELECT FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF('XXXX-XX-XX','XXXX-XX-XX'))'. </li>
